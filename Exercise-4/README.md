1) The addLine function, within an AutoCAD application using the ObjectARX API, performs the following steps:

2) Get the Current Database:
      Retrieves the current drawing's database by obtaining a pointer to it.

3) Open the Block Table for Read-Only:
      Allows read-only access to the Block Table, which holds information about blocks in the drawing.

4) Get the Model Space Block:
      Retrieves the Block Table Record for the Model Space, a special block where drawing entities are typically placed.

5) Define Start and End Points for the Line:
      Specifies the 3D coordinates for the start and end points of the new line.


6) Create a New Line Object:
      Allocates memory for a new AcDbLine object, representing a straight line entity in AutoCAD.

7) Append the Line to Model Space:
      Adds the newly created line object to the Model Space Block Table Record, effectively placing the line in the drawing.

8) Close Model Space Block:
      Closes the Model Space Block Table Record, ensuring proper resource handling.

9) Close the New Line Object:
      Releases resources associated with the new line object, an essential step in memory management.

10) In summary, the function efficiently inserts a straight line into the current drawing's Model Space by defining its coordinates and managing memory and resources appropriately.
