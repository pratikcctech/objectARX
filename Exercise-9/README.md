Debugging Setup - ObjectARX Project
Overview
This guide outlines the steps to set up and configure the ObjectARX project for debugging in Visual Studio. Debugging allows you to analyze the program's behavior, inspect variables, and troubleshoot issues effectively during development.

Setup Steps
1. Create Debug Version:
Build a debug version of the ObjectARX project in Visual Studio.
2. Configure Project Properties:
Open the ObjectARX project in Microsoft Visual Studio.
Configure the project properties for debugging.
3. Adjust Debugging Settings:
Adjust settings in the project properties to enable debugging, including compiler and linker options.
4. Set Breakpoints:
Place breakpoints in the code at specific locations where you want the debugger to pause execution for inspection.
Usage
Build Debug Version:

Open the ObjectARX project in Microsoft Visual Studio.
Build the debug version of the project.
Configure Project for Debugging:

Adjust project properties for debugging. 
This includes compiler and linker options specific to debugging.
Adjust Debugging Settings:

Fine-tune debugging settings in the project properties to suit your development needs.
Set Breakpoints:

Identify critical points in your code where you want to inspect variables or step through the execution.
Set breakpoints at these locations.
Run in Debug Mode:

Run the ObjectARX project in debug mode using Visual Studio.
Inspect Variables:

When the debugger hits a breakpoint, you can inspect the values of variables, step through the code, and analyze program behavior.
