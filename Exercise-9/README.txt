1.Created a debug version of the ObjectARX project in Visual Studio.
2.Configured the project properties for debugging.
3.Adjusted settings in the project properties to enable debugging, including compiler and linker options.
4.Set breakpoints for debugging.

Placed breakpoints in the code at specific locations where you want the debugger to pause execution for inspection.
These steps prepare your ObjectARX project for debugging, allowing you to analyze the program's behavior,
inspect variables, and troubleshoot issues effectively during development.
