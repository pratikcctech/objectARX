1) This code defines a function called inputLine that, when executed,
2) prompts the user to input two points and creates a line based on these points in the current space of the AutoCAD drawing.

3) The inputLine function:
    1.Gets the current AutoCAD database.
    2.Retrieves the current space block (usually Model Space or Paper Space).
    3.Prompts the user to input the first point using acedGetPoint.
    4.If the first point is successfully obtained, prompts the user for the second point.
    5.If both points are successfully obtained, creates a new AcDbLine object using the specified points.
    6.Appends the new Line object to the current space block.
    7.Closes the current space block and the Line object.

4) This function allows the user to draw a line in AutoCAD by inputting two points interactively. The line is then added to the current space block of the drawing.
